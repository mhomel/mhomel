## Hi there 👋 I'm Madzia

🧠 Cognitive science student exploring how to make machines think more like people do — imperfectly, contextually, and with goals that shift over time.  
📍 Kraków / Remote

### 🌱 Currently learning
- Python (PyCharm, Jupyter)  
- Pandas, NumPy & scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Thinking in systems — human and machine

### 🔜 Next in line
- Deeper dive into ML concepts
- First steps into NLP and neural networks 
- PyTorch (because neurons aren't just biological)
- SQL (because not everything fits in a CSV)
- Learning how to explain models, not just train them

### 🧪 Projects

- `🧠 Simon’s Task`  
  A cognitively inspired experiment based on the classic Simon effect. Participants respond to the meaning of the word (“LEFT” or “RIGHT”) while ignoring its on-screen position - creating congruent or incongruent stimulus-response conditions.  
  → Focus: reaction time, spatial compatibility, attention interference  
  → Tools: Python + PsychoPy-style logic
  | Designed as part of a 3-person academic collaboration |

- `🩺 Doctor Data`  
  A classification task using logistic regression and scikit-learn. Built around a fictional dataset of patients.  
  → Focus: medical logic, binary decisions, explainability

- `📊 Data Detective`  
  Exploratory analysis of synthetic patient data using Pandas and NumPy.  
  → Focus: grouping, visualization, asking the right questions

### 💭 What I do

- I learn. Actively, intentionally — and not just by doing tutorials.  
- I write Python code that helps me explore decision-making, memory and how small models can reflect human thought — or sometimes reveal it.  
- I study how systems - both biological and artificial - reason, fail, and adapt.

> *Still learning — but not blindly.*

Recently, I also completed a game-based behavioral assessment focused on decision-making, initiative and collaboration.  
It helped me understand how I actually work, not just how I describe myself.

### 🧠 What I care about

- AI agents that are understandable, not just accurate  
- Cognitive modeling and memory-based reasoning  
- Tools that make sense of ambiguity, not avoid it  
- Self-awareness in systems and in learning
