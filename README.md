## Hi there 👋 I'm Madzia

🧠 Cognitive science student exploring how to make machines think more like people do - imperfectly, contextually, and with goals that shift over time.  
📍 Kraków / Remote

### 🌱 Currently learning
- Python (PyCharm, Jupyter)  
- Pandas, NumPy & scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Thinking in systems - human and machine

### 🔜 Next in line
- Deeper dive into ML concepts
- First steps into NLP and neural networks 
- PyTorch (because neurons aren't just biological)
- SQL (because not everything fits in a CSV)
- Learning how to explain models, not just train them

  > *I'm not done learning — and that's the point.*

### 🧪 Projects

- `🧠 Simon’s Task`  
  A cognitively inspired experiment based on the classic Simon effect. Participants respond to the meaning of the word (“LEFT” or “RIGHT”) while ignoring its on-screen position - creating congruent or incongruent stimulus-response conditions.  
  → Focus: reaction time, spatial compatibility, attention interference  
  → Tools: Python + PsychoPy-style logic  
  → Designed as part of a 3-person academic collaboration  
  🔗 [View the full project here](https://github.com/mhomel/simons-task-experiment)

- `📊 Client Insight`  
  A small self-directed project based on randomly generated client data. I used it to practice data cleaning, feature creation, visualizations, and training a simple classifier to predict satisfaction based on age and income.  
  → Focus: Pandas, matplotlib, logistic regression  
  → Tools: Python, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

- `🧬 Diagnosis Playground`  
  A beginner-friendly project based on fictional patient data. I used it to simulate diagnostic reasoning through condition-based classification, feature engineering, and group analysis (e.g. average BMI by health status).  
  → Focus: condition logic, feature creation, group statistics  
  → Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib

### 💭 What I do

- I learn. Actively, intentionally - and not just by doing tutorials.  
- I write Python code that helps me explore decision-making, memory and how small models can reflect human thought - or sometimes reveal it.  
- I study how systems - both biological and artificial - reason, fail, and adapt.


### 🧩 How I work

I believe how we think and decide is just as important as what we know.  
Recently, I completed a game-based behavioral assessment that evaluated how I make decisions, take initiative, and collaborate.

🧠 Curious how I actually work - not just how I would describe myself?

### 🧠 What I care about

- AI agents that are understandable, not just accurate  
- Cognitive modeling and memory-based reasoning  
- Tools that make sense of ambiguity, not avoid it  
- Self-awareness in systems and in learning
